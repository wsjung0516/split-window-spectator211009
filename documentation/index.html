<h1 id="splitwindowspectator211009">SplitWindowSpectator211009</h1>
<p>This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> version 12.2.0.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This program combines and applies the Angular technologies that have been applied when performing the previous project.
It aims to implement various image categories quickly and in grid format in real time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a file in advance that stores the url of the image by crawling by image group (category) in Google,
The image is read in real time with the image url in this file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since there is no separate backend server, the status of the image server and
depending on the traffic situation, the loading speed for each image may differ significantly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since it takes a lot of time to load the image, webworker technology is applied to compensate for this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And, once read images are stored by applying a cache to display them quickly later.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The user selects one group (category), and while the image is caching, another group is selected.
Since it is selectable, webworker technology is applied to prevent the image display time from being delayed at this time.
Then, even if another category is selected while loading the image of the previously selected category,
program was developed to enable image loading by immediately changing to another group.</p>
<h3 id="caching-image">Caching image</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Since the user can randomly select an image category, all categories are in one cache.
Save the images regardless of the order and category in which they are read,</p>
</li>
<li><p>When displaying images for each group, the cached images were implemented to
select and display only the group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At this time, it takes a lot of time to sort by category, so by applying webworker technology,
program was made it possible to select by category.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the user selects a category, if there is already caching for that category
display the data, and if there is images that has not yet been loaded in that category
reading images from server and caching is also carried out concurrently.</p>
<h3 id="split-window">Split window</h3>
</li>
<li><p>The grid (window split) function is difficult to customize when using the existing library.
Implemented by applying directive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When implementing a split window, each split window needs the process of displaying each image group (category).
At this time, only the first image of images in each window is displayed first, and when that operation (the first image is displayed)
is finished, immediately The next split window starts working.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each split window consists of a separate component. Therefore, each split window
must have its own variable. A unique variable for each split window is kept in the service program.
This is the difficult part of the program. <a href="src/assets/md/grid.md">Details</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Each split window is assigned by category, and each split window
The start and end points of drawing should be stored in global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Therefore, each split window decides by itself whether the previous split window has finished its work.
When the previous split window has finished image processing, draw the first image of it&#39;s category,
When the image drawing is completed, the state is immediately stored in a global variable.
Then, the next split window waits and starts drawing the image for that category.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And, from the second image, caching and saving work is also carried out by webworker as a background job at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only through this process can each split window maintain its own id.
It is possible to control each split window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overall-diagram">Overall diagram</h2>
<p><img src="src/assets/md/images/split-structure.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></p>
<ul>
<li>Series list: Image list displayed by category on the left side of the screen</li>
<li>Thumbnail list: Image list displayed by category at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Main viewer: The part where the selected image is displayed from among the
images separated by category and in the middle on the screen</li>
<li>When split window is selected, it is displayed separately in grid form.<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">Below seq. no is related with above diagram.
1: If category is selected, the selected information is transmitted.
2: When the thumbnail information is updated, the thumbnail list recognizes this.
3: The information received in step 1 is transmitted to the carousel-main program
 through the status information.
4: The information passed to carousel-main is checked after identifying the 
 information stored in image-cache. If it is not saved, the image is read through 
 the image webworker and stored in the image cache.
5: When the program is first started, the image is read through the webworker 
 and then stored in the image store.
6: Images stored in the image store are displayed as a series (category) list.
7: As the image url is stored in NgXS and the state (NgXS) changes at the same time,
 the thumbnail list display program operates.
 Displays images stored in the cache as thumbnails.
8: When each window (split window) operates, the webworker for each window operates
 image reading is performed from the server.
9: Because the image display operation is delayed by continuing only the image
 loading operation.
 In order to naturally display only the first page on the screen, cache the 
 rest of the pages by using webworker function
10: Images are stored uncategorically in the cache.
 When displaying on the screen, sorting by the selected category is performed 
 using a separate webworker.</code></pre></div></li>
